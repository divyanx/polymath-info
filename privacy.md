# Privacy Policy for Polymath - LifeOS

Last updated: [DATE]

## Overview
Polymath - LifeOS is designed to keep your data private. We do not run our own servers, and we do not sell or share your data.

## Data We Collect
- **Your content:** Tasks, habits, projects, and other data you create in the app.
- **We do not collect analytics or tracking data.**
- **No account required:** The app does not require a separate app account or login.

## Where Your Data Lives
- **On your device:** Data is stored locally on your device.
- **In your iCloud (optional):** If you enable iCloud sync, your data is stored in your personal iCloud account using Apple CloudKit. We do not have access to your iCloud data.

## Calendar Access (Optional)
If you enable calendar integration, the app requests access to your device's calendar to sync tasks. This data is processed locally and, if iCloud sync is enabled, may be synced via your iCloud. We never see your calendar events.

## Third-Party Services
The only third-party service used for sync is **Apple iCloud/CloudKit**, which is governed by Apple's privacy policy. We do not share your data with any other third parties.

## Data Retention and Deletion
- You can delete items directly in the app.
- You can clear local data from the app's settings.
- If iCloud sync is enabled, deleting items in the app will sync deletions across your devices.
- We do not store your data on our own servers, so we cannot delete data on your behalf.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with a new "Last updated" date.
